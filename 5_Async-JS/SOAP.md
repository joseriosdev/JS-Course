# Simple Object Access Protocol

Is the older protocol for sending info, it is safer than rest but is bigger than rest meaning less easy to use. However is build for certain case scenarios.

SOAP provides the Messaging Protocol layer of a web services protocol stack for web services. It is an XML-based protocol consisting of three parts:

* an envelope, which defines the message structure[1] and how to process it
* a set of encoding rules for expressing instances of application-defined datatypes
* a convention for representing procedure calls and responses

SOAP has three major characteristics:

1. _extensibility_ (security and WS-Addressing are among the extensions under development)
2. _neutrality_ (SOAP can operate over any protocol such as HTTP, SMTP, TCP, UDP)
3. _independence_ (SOAP allows for any programming model)
