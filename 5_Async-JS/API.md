# Application Programming Interface (API)

Is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other.

There are apis build in within JS, for example, when using a canvas element, you're consuming that api. Nonetheless the common use of this world is when talking about web apis. Apis that can be used on the web only, for example the [trello API](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/trello/rest/api-group-actions/). So any url that allows you to use any of the REST verbs is a web api and the end of that url is called endpoint.

You can create your own api, but that is not included in this course's scope.
