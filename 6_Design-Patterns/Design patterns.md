# What's a Design Pattern?
> Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code. _-FactoryGuru-_

There are two types of patterns, **idiom** patterns refers to patterns that can only be applied in one programming language; **architectural patterns** covers a lot of ground, many programming languages can use them. There is another subset of patterns, these three:

* __Behavioral -__ take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
* __Structural -__ explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and efficient.
* __Creational -__ provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
