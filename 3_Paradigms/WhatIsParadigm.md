A paradigm is a collection of beliefs that are held by a group of people. That's the general assumption of a term that not only refers to programming. Take the paradigm that says _"you need to have a traditional job"_ that paradigm includes these ideas:

* You must have a job to be a contributing member of society
* The better your education the better your job
* How often do you ask a person what's her job?
