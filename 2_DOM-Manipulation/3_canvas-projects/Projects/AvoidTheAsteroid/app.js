/*
THE PROJECT

Part 1
* inserting images in the canvas, do a game
* the game should have an asteroid bouncing all around
* you should have a ship image that travels from (0,canvas.height/2) to (canvas.width,canvas.height/2)
* if the space ship collides with the asteroid, you lose
* to avoid a collide, add the next game mechanic:
	- when a player clicks in any part inside the canvas, the space ship does a forward dash

Part 2
* Improve the game mechanic and add a score
* Every time that the asteroid bounce, increase the score & increase (+0.1) to the bouncing speed
* Once the player lose, ask for his nickname and save it inside of an array
* Show the session rank of the players who played the game on the side
