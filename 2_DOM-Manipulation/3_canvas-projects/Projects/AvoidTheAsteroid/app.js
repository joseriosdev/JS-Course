/*
THE PROJECT

* Write a program that takes the user info (firstName, lastName, age and planet) and saves it inside an Object Literal
* Greet the user
* Then tell the user what his age will be in +10 years
* Ask (true or false) if the user can fly by his own and if had met groot
	- If both are true, then his civilization is interplanetary
* Populate an extra field saying if the user is interplanetary
* Once prev requirements are done, re-factor it so it saves three users in an array
