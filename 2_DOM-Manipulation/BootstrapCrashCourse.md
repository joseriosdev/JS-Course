# [Get Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/)

From now on, try to use bootstrap or any CSS framework for the projects.

If you want to change the color palette, use [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) and change the link href when importing it with https://bootswatch.com/4/cyborg/bootstrap.min.css changing where says "cyborg" for the name of the palette.

> There are no need for crash course at all, just read the documentation it's pretty much clear.
